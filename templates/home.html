  Tourism in India is 4.6% of the country's GDP. Unlike other sectors, tourism is not a priority sector for the
  Government
  of India. Forbes magazine ranked India as the 7th most beautiful country in the 'The 50 Most Beautiful Countries In
  The World' rankings.<br>[1] The World Travel and Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹13.2 lakh crore
  (US$170 billion) or 5.8% of India's GDP and supported 32.1 million jobs in 2021. Even though these numbers were
  lower than the pre-pandemic figures, the country's economy witnessed significant growth in 2021 after the massive
  downturn during 2020. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 7.8% to ₹33.8 lakh crore (US$420 billion)
  by 2031 (7.2% of GDP).<br>[2] In October 2015,
  According to Ministry of Tourism, Over 6.19 million and 1.52 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2022 &
  2021 respectively compared to 10.93 million in 2019, representing a -44% degrowth.[5]<br>[6] India has bigger domestic
  tourist population so it's not dependent on foreign tourist much. This makes India the 22nd most visited nation in
  the world and 8th in Asia and Pacific .<br>[7] Domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories numbered
  1,036.35 million in 2012, an increase of 16.5% from 2011.<br>[8] In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named
  the state Kerala as one of the "ten paradises of the world" and "50 must see destinations of a lifetime".
  <br>[9] In
  2014, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were the most popular states for tourists.<br>[10] Delhi, Mumbai,
  Chennai, Agra and Jaipur were the five most visited cities of India by foreign tourists during the year 2015. As of
  2017, worldwide, Delhi is ranked 28th by the number of foreign tourist arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked 30th,
  Chennai 43rd, Agra 45th, Jaipur 52nd and Kolkata 90th.....<a href="{% url 'extension' %}">read more</a><br><br>
