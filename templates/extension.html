        INDIAN TOURISM
    </h1>
    <P>
        Tourism in India is 4.6% of the country's GDP, Unlike other sectors Tourism is not a priority sector for
        Government of India. Forbes magazine ranked India as the 7th most beautiful country in the 'The 50 Most
        Beautiful Countries In The World' rankings.[1] The World Travel and Tourism Council calculated that tourism
        generated ₹13.2 lakh crore (US$170 billion) or 5.8% of India's GDP and supported 32.1 million jobs in 2021. Even
        though, these numbers were lower than the pre-pandemic figures; the country's economy witnessed a significant
        growth in 2021 after the massive downturn during 2020. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 7.8%
        to ₹33.8 lakh crore (US$420 billion) by 2031 (7.2% of GDP).[2] In October 2015, India's medical tourism sector
        was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020.[3] In 2014,
        184,298 foreign patients travelled to India to seek medical treatment.[4]

        According to Ministry of Tourism, Over 6.19 million and 1.52 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2022 &
        2021 respectively compared to 10.93 million in 2019, representing a -44% degrowth.[5][6] India has bigger
        domestic tourist population so it's not dependent on foreign tourist much. This makes India the 22nd most
        visited nation in the world and 8th in Asia and Pacific .[7] Domestic tourist visits to all states and union
        territories numbered 1,036.35 million in 2012, an increase of 16.5% from 2011.[8] In 2012, National Geographic's
        Traveller magazine named the state Kerala as one of the "ten paradises of the world" and "50 must see
        destinations of a lifetime".[9] In 2014, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were the most popular states
        for tourists.[10] Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Agra and Jaipur were the five most visited cities of India by foreign
        tourists during the year 2015. As of 2017, worldwide, Delhi is ranked 28th by the number of foreign tourist
        arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked 30th, Chennai 43rd, Agra 45th, Jaipur 52nd and Kolkata 90th.[11]

        The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index 2021, which replaced its previous Travel and
        Tourism Competitiveness Report, ranks India 54th out of 117 countries overall.[12] The last edition of the
        Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, published in 2019, had ranked India 34th out of 140 countries
        overall. The report ranked the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 13th out of 140 countries. It
        mentioned that India has quite good air transport infrastructure (ranked 33rd), particularly given the country's
        stage of development, and reasonable ground and port infrastructure (ranked 28th). The country also scored high
        on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources and business travel (ranked 8th).[13] The World
        Tourism Organization reported that India's receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked 16th in the world, and 7th
        among Asian and Pacific countries.[14]

        The Ministry of Tourism designs national policies for the development and promotion of tourism. In the process,
        the Ministry consults and collaborates with other stakeholders in the sector including various central
        ministries/agencies, state governments, union territories and private sector representatives. Concerted efforts
        are being made to promote niche tourism products such as rural, cruise, medical and eco-tourism.[15] The
        Ministry of Tourism maintains the Incredible India campaign focused on promoting tourism in India.
